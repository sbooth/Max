Mac::Growl provides an interface for perl scripts to connect to Growl,
allowing them to register with it, and send it notifications to be
displayed.

See http://growl.info for more information on growl,
or consult man Mac::Growl or perldoc Mac::Growl after installation for
more details on the module, or perldoc lib/Mac/Growl.pm beforehand.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   sudo make
   make test
   sudo make install

Note that sudo may be required for make, as well as make install.  If you
get an error from trying to create a glue file during make, make clean
and try again with sudo.

make test will register "PerlApp" with growl with Growl, with two
notifications, "test 1" and "test 2", and then post to those notification with
various messages.  Since there is currently no Growl->Caller communication,
there is no way for the test script to tell if it's working, and therefore will
always report success. If you don't see the notification, check console, wait
a while and try again, and/or ask in #growl on irc.freenode.net.

DEPENDENCIES

This module should work on any Mac OS X system, although it requires
the developer tools to build and install.  See the docs for more information.

If using Mac::Glue with Mac::Growl, Mac::Glue 1.24 may be needed to create
a new glue file for Growl 0.7, so a glue file is included and installed for
you if you are using Mac::Glue 1.23 or earlier.
