	include/cddb/cddb_net.h, lib/cddb_net.c, lib/cddb_track.c: Changes

	* include/cddb/cddb_net.h: Yet another artifact from broken OSX
	10.2 includes.

2004-04-04 04:13  rockyb

	cddb_config.h.in.

2004-04-04 04:11  rockyb

	* configure.ac, include/cddb/cddb_config.h.in,
	include/cddb/cddb_regex.h: Start public config settings. (Initial)
	motivation
	
	OSX needs #include <unistd.h> before #include <regex.h> This is
	perhaps a clean way to do this.

2004-03-10 04:17  rockyb

	* examples/do_display.c: Add string.h for strlen.

2004-03-10 04:08  rockyb

2004-03-08 13:54  rockyb

	to GNU.

2004-03-08 02:30  rockyb

	* configure.ac, examples/Makefile.am: *: Use pkgconfig to get
	libcdio properties. (We now require 0.67). In particular we need
	CFLAGS and LD_FLAGS.
	
	configure.ac: Bump CVS number to 0.65cvs so people do not confuse
	with 0.64.

2004-03-03 13:39  rockyb

	* lib/.cvsignore: more CVS lint.

2004-03-03 13:38  rockyb

	* tests/.cvsignore: settings.sh is derived.

2004-03-03 13:35  rockyb

	* tests/check_server.sh: On some shells and "test" (like on
	Solaris) don't like   test -z $foo gives a required argument
	missing.
	
	  test -z "$foo"
	
	works though.

2004-03-03 13:31  rockyb

	* .cvsignore: libcddb.pc is a derived file.

	warning.

2004-03-02 01:36  rockyb

	* configure.ac: automake wants AM_CONFIG_HEADER rather than
	AC_CONFIG_HEADERS.  We can work with autoconf as far back as 2.55.

2004-03-02 01:32  rockyb

	* lib/cddb_net.c: Remove compiler warning of memset implicit
	declaration. Use HAVE_...H defines in the config.h.
