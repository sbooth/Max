MusicBrainz Web Service XML Examples
------------------------------------

This directory contains example XML code for testing an implementation.

Implementations MUST be able to parse the XML in the 'valid' directory.
It is perfect, schema-compliant XML.

The 'invalid' directory contains all kinds of invalid XML. Implementations
are not expected to parse those files. They MAY, however.
